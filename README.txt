This project is to predict the nature of android apks after analyzing a dataset of apk fies, which contains both malicious and benign applications.


STEP 1: Build the environment
	*Create folders named "apkfiles", "Benign_Apks", "Malicious_Apks", "tester", "Dataset".
	*apkfiles		: Holds extracted and renamed apkfile folders containing the resources needed for analysis
	*dataset 		: Contains the original unaltered dataset, and for space efficiency deletes its files when dumping the apks 				  in their respective folders	
	*Benign_Apks	: Contains the set of benign apks extracted from the Dataset folders
	*Malicious_Apks	: Contains the malicious apks from the Dataset folder
	*tester 		: Contains the testdata(apks selected at random from the benign/malicious folders)

STEP 2: Data Collection
	*Run script to extract the files from their zip folders
	*Now run the script "rename.sh" which renames all the apk files to a workable format
	*Run the shell script "run.sh", after pasting it inside Benign, and Malicious apk folders, which will set up the apkfiles  folder
	*Run the script "rename.sh" in both apk folders, to construct the tester folder
	*Next step is to run the python code "dataset_constructor.py", instructions to run it are given in the documentation
	*Raw_Dataset.txt is generated now

STEP 3: Data Refining and scoring
	*Run the code "fisher_scoring.py", instructions to run it are given in the documentation
	*Raw_Dataset.txt contains the raw dataset, with the fisherscore of each feature
	*On running the code "refine_dataset.py", a refined and feature selected dataset is obtained, instructions to run it are given in the documentation
	*Final_set.txt is now obtained

STEP 4: SVM_Classification andAccuracy obtaining
	*Run code "SVM_classification.py", instructions to run it are given in the documentation, to obtain a model
	*This model can be use, and a K-Fold cross-validation, our case 10
	*Results obtianed are shown on running the code

Some scripts delete themselves after being run, copies must be kept untouched and when they are run only then must they be copy pasted into the directory they need to be run in.
